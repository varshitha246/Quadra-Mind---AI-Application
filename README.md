1️⃣ TEXT SUMMARIZATION TOOL 🧠

📝 A Python-based tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate concise summaries from long text.
⚙️ Built using Flask to provide a clean web interface.
🧠 Implements extractive summarization to retain the most important sentences.
✅ Useful for summarizing articles, blogs, or research content.

2️⃣ SPEECH RECOGNITION 🗣️

🎤 A web-based application that converts spoken audio into text using Python and Flask.
⚙️ Accepts audio file uploads and returns transcribed text.
🧠 Uses the speech_recognition library to perform voice transcription.
✅ Great for transcribing short audio clips or recorded speech.

4️⃣ TEXT GENERATION ✍🏻

✍️ A web-based tool that generates text from user input using deep learning.
⚙️ Built using Flask for the front-end and Keras (LSTM model) for generation.
🧠 Trained on a corpus to generate coherent and meaningful paragraphs.
✅ Useful for writing assistance, content generation, and experimentation.
